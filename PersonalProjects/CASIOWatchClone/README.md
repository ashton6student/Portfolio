In this project, I used the ESP-32 microcontroller, as well as the Arduino IDE to create a CASIO watch clone system on a breadboard displayed to an OLED display. I based it off the CASIO A158WA-1, which has the following capabilities: Display time (In both standard and military time) which can be adjusted, the day and day of the week which can be adjusted, an alarm, and a stopwatch. To cycle through and control these states, it uses three buttons and a buzzer for the alarm, which is why I used such for my implementation.
In this folder, you can find the documentation for the CASIO A158WA-1 watch in which I based my code, a video showing the implementation in action in comparison to the CASIO A158WA-1, as well as the actual code programmed on the ESP-32.
