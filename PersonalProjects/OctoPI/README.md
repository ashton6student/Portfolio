For this project, I hooked up a RaspberryPi to my Ender 3 v2 3D printer in order to connect it to OctoPi, a SD card image of OctoPrint running on the Raspberry Pi. I then set up remote internet to the Raspberry Pi through the OctoEverywhere plugin. This allows for remote connection to my 3D printer anywhere with an internet connection, allowing for remote printing and monitoring through a Raspberry Pi camera.
Images of printer setup are included in this folder, as well as images of the webpage showing my remote access to this printer. A video is also included showing the printer printing through this remote connection.
