In this project, I designed a PCB board using EasyEDA Pro for use in the LucidGlovesV5 open-source project. The image of the PCB board as well as the circuit diagram is included in this folder. I then soldered said components to the PCB board. Finally, I designed and 3D printed a housing for said PCB using Inventor, allowing for it to be powered by batteries and to be mounted on my arm. The CAD files as well as images of the 3D printed housing is included in this folder.
The LucidGloves open-source project is a virtual reality glove project, meant to be compatible with most modern VR systems like the Meta Quest and Valve Index, as well as in Unity for one's own VR-related development. V5 of this project includes finger tracking using hall effect sensors, as well as servo motors for haptic feedback. 
I mainly did this project as a way to develop my engineering soft skills while also exploring a topic that interests me, virtual reality. I developed skills such as PCB design and ordering, 3D modeling, and 3D printing.
For PCB design, I learned basic methods such as having a power and ground plate and using vias for eaiser wiring. I also developed my 3D modeling skills in which I had to import the CAD model for the PCB and design around it. I also had to learn to tweak 3D printer slicer settings as the relatively small components lead to small desired printing tolerances, such as minimizing printing issues such as elephant's foot. Finally, I learned to solder for this project, as I had to solder pin connector ports, an ESP-32 microcontroller, a multiplexer board, a test LED, and buttons to the PCB.
