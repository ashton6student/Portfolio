For this lab, we were tasked with creating a logical processor capable of the AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR operations on two inputted numbers. We first implemented this processor on a breadboard in which each input has a bit width of 8 bits (An image showing our breadboard implementation is included in this folder). We then implemented this processor in SystemVerilog now increasing our bit width to 16 bits (You can find our SystemVerilog code in the Code Files folder). For more details on exactly what we did, please refer to the included lab report.
