THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS, AS THE CLASS THIS IS BEING DONE FOR IS YET TO COMPLETE.
This project isn't for a specific lab, but is more files I'll be using across the class. In specific, for this class, we are communicating with multiple sensors on a PCB board through an Opal Kelly FPGA. The schematic for this PCB board is included in this folder. 
Most sensors we have used so far communicate via the I2C communcation protocol. The 'I2C_Transmit.v' file is the verilog code used on our FPGA to communicate with these sensors in conjuction with the Python file also included in this folder. By the end of this class, I hope to get it to work with all the I2C sensors on the PCB board. Currently it works for the IMU (magnetic sensor and accelerometer), as well as the temperature sensor. Keep in mind I am actively updating and interating on this code, meaning it might change rapidly in capabilities week by week.
